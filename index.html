      <p>
        I’m originally from Colombia and currently living in Georgia. I work as
        a Relationship Banker at Bank of America while also attending CTD. I
        have a strong interest in aerospace and computer engineering and am
        exploring my options for higher education. I’m considering pursuing an
        associate degree in CS or engineering at GSU Perimeter for its
        affordability and transfer opportunities to Georgia Tech as an
        international student to further my academic and career goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, hiking, and reading books.
        I also have a strong interest in languages and am planning to learn more
        languages in the future to expand my skills and cultural understanding.
